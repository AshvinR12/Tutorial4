# Referencing tables 

We generate Table \@ref(tab:species) using the *kable* package  

```{r species, cache = TRUE}

Table = penguins %>%
  count(species)

knitr::kable(
Table, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Individual number of penguins studied in each species')

```

 In Table \@ref(tab:species) the first number of penguins studied in each of the groups is diplayed


# Referencing figures

```{r visualizingpenguins, fig.cap = "Relationship between flipper length and body mass", warning = FALSE}

ggplot(penguins, aes( x= flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = species, color = species))


```


```{r distribution, fig.cap = "Distribution of flippers lenght accross different penguin species", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

The relationship between flipper length and body mass is displayed in  Figure \@ref(fig:visualizingpenguins).

In Figure \@ref(fig:distribution) we can observed differences in the distribution of flipper length across three different types of penguins in Antarctica.

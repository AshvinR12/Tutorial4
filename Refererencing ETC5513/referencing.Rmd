# Data set

In Table \@ref(tab:dat) we can observe the different measurements that were collected for three different types of penguins in the Antarctic peninsula.

```{r dat}

head(penguins) %>%
  kable(caption = "Summary of the data about penguins collected in the Palmer research station in the Antarctic peninsula")
```
```{r penguintypes, out.width = '70%', echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Types of penguins found in the Antarctic Palmer research station"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/penguins.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:penguintypes) depicts the three different types of penguins found near the Antarctic Palmer research station.

# Referencing tables 

We generate Table \@ref(tab:species) using the *kable* package  

```{r species, cache = TRUE}

Table = penguins %>%
  count(species)

knitr::kable(
Table, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Describes the individual number of penguins studied for each species')

```

Table \@ref(tab:species) displays the number of penguins surveyed for each of the species.

# Referencing figures

```{r visualizingpenguins, fig.cap = "Relationship between flipper length and body mass", warning = FALSE}

ggplot(penguins, aes( x= flipper_length_mm,
                      y = body_mass_g)
       ) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = species,
                 color = species))


```


```{r distribution, fig.cap = "Distribution of flippers lenght accross different penguin species", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm,
                     fill = species)
       ) +
  geom_histogram()
```

The relationship between flipper length and body mass is displayed in  Figure \@ref(fig:visualizingpenguins).In Figure \@ref(fig:distribution) we can observed differences in the distribution of flipper length across three different types of penguins in Antarctica.
